# Project Governance

This document outlines how decisions are made and how contributors can be involved in project governance.

## Roles

### Core Team
- Maintains the project
- Reviews and merges contributions
- Sets project direction

### Contributors
- Submit issues or pull requests
- Improve documentation, code, or design

### Maintainers
- Appointed by the Core Team
- Have commit access and review authority

## Decision Making

We strive for consensus. If consensus canâ€™t be reached:
- Core Team votes
- Majority rules

Major decisions (e.g., breaking changes, rewrites) are discussed in GitHub Discussions or meetings.

## Meetings

Core maintainers may host public meetings via Zoom/Discord. Agendas and notes will be published in the `docs/` folder.

## Changes to Governance

Proposed in a GitHub PR with a 72-hour feedback window.
